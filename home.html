<h1 style="background-color:violet;">Liver Patient Analysis</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;"> Liver Failure is a serious condition and it affects the patientâ€™s life time. Disease identification is the most crucial task
for treating any disease. Liver disease can be inherited genetically or caused by a variety of subjects that damage the liver.
Machine learning technique is broadly used in various grounds of science and technology. They have been giving out meaningful
information. It also explores in creation and study of algorithms which can learn from data. Data mining in healthcare is an
evolving field of high importance for providing diagnosis and a deeper understanding of medical data. To build an effective
disease management strategy, large amount of data should be analyzed for the early detection of the disease, assessment of the
severity and early prediction of adverse events. This will impede the progression of the disease, will improve the quality of life of
the patients and will reduce the associated medical costs. The aim of this research paper is to present the state-of-the-art of the
machine learning methodologies applied for the prediction of liver failure. The main objective of this research work is to find the
best classification algorithm in terms of precision, accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, the present investigation was
done to determine the relative performance of four classification algorithms namely, Support Vector machine (SVM), Logistic
Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithm based on the available downloaded Indian Liver Patient Dataset(ILPD).</p>
